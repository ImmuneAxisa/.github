ImmuneAxisa hosts academic work from Pierre-Paul Axisa and colleagues. I work at [CRCT](https://www.crct-inserm.fr), where I analyse transcriptomic and epigenetic assays to study in the immune system in cancer, aging, and autoimmunity.

You can check my academic work on [google scholar](https://t.co/ivt1cSuzVI), follow and contact me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/ppaxisa)
